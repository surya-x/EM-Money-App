# EM-Money-App

FinTech app developed for the organisation (EM Money). This will provide a platform for purchase, redemption of Mutual Funds by integrating it with NSE (National Stock Exchange) & BSE along with tracking the transactions. It will also provide support for loan approval and other benefits.


The idea is to keep the app simple and scalable while using new libraries and tools which makes it easier to build high quality Android applications.
